# Papers

Prior to a paper presentation please add your paper in the `papers` folder, naming the PDF after its title ( <title.pdf> ) so we have a copy and make sure we do not present the same paper twice.

Don't forget to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/nlp_club/wiki) for video and other references.
